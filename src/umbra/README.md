# Umbra - a lightweight scene manager
This directory contains the source code of Umbra, a lightweight game framework that handles the scene graph, user input and provide an event bus.

Right now, the framework is pretty empty as it contains only what is needed by GeneRogue. More features will be supported as the game gets more complex.

# TODO

Reminder for stuff that might be added to the framework. Or not.

* Core

* Scene management

* User input
    - is all AxisData stuff from Unity really needed ?
    
* Event bus
